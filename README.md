# Quantify & take control of time spent on Discord
## About timecord

timecord is a library-in-development that seeks to:
- Track time spent on Discord
- Track time spent on specific servers & channels
- Close Discord after too much time is spent
...without violating Discord ToS!

The library is in early development.  Completed features include:
- Functions to determine _current_ server/channel name.

#### Areas for improvement:
- Support for non-Mac OS devices

#### Dependencies:
- Pillow
- Easyocr
- Python-crontab

With the rise of Discord as a platform for teams and friend groups alike, it's important to watch your time management on the platform. There are no current apps specifically for discord time management, so this library aims to fill that gap.
